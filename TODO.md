# TODOs

- [x] Add `String` token support (Parser)

      multiple functions.
- [ ] Tail call optimisation (eval)
- [ ] Fraction rep. on divide function
- [x] Add autocomplete support
- [ ] Fix autocomplete support for `lib` functions
- [ ] Method abstractions
- [ ] Library to be split based on the purpose that they serve.
- [ ] Errors with error codes with their respective messages.
- [ ] Change the way the AST is consumed, use all the details (this is required for bindings)
- [x] Add `map` data structure.
- [-] Add `map` based core-lib functions
  - [x] assoc
  - [x] dissoc
- [ ] Add `prettier` and maybe `es-lint` too.
- [ ] Add examples & docs for each function
- [ ] Add support for nested `map`(s)
