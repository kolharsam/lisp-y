# TODOs

-   [x] Add `String` token support (Parser)
-   [ ] Parser step 1 is too tightly-coupled at the moment. Change it by separating the logic into
        multiple functions.
-   [x] Tail call optimisation (eval)
-   [ ] Fraction rep. on divide function
-   [x] Add autocomplete support
-   [ ] Fix autocomplete support for `lib` functions
-   [ ] Method abstractions
-   [ ] Library to be split based on the purpose that they serve.
-   [x] Error reporting as a separate module, consistent reporting throughout.
-   [ ] Change the way the AST is consumed, use all the details (this is required for bindings)
-   [x] Add `map` data structure.
-   [ ] Add `map` based core-lib functions
    -   [x] assoc
    -   [x] dissoc
-   [x] Add `prettier`.
-   [ ] Add examples, docs and test for each function within the core lib
