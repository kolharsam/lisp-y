# lisp-y

```
(apply str (interpose " " (list "My" "attempt" "at" "making" "a" "lisp")))

// Output: "My attempt at making a lisp"
```

## Notes

As of now, only some methods have been added which can be evaluated. But yes, over time I hope to keep building on this.

The functions and most of the syntax is going to be based off of `clojure`.
If you've not encountered it yet, have a look.

Use the [Makefile](https://github.com/kolharsam/lisp-y/blob/feature/eval-functions/Makefile) to run the REPL.

If you'd like then, leave some comments on anything that you feel can be bettered or changed.
