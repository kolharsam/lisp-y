# Project Roadmap

```text
This is a note for me. For anyone who's exploring this codebase.
```

Since the idea is to build a LISP that is inspired by the likes of `Clojure`, `CommonLisp` & `Scheme`to _list_ a few.

As of now, we've got something's that can evaluate a handful of expressions, and you can write some small programs with it too.

There are many many more items that I/we should check off before we can call it a complete programming language.

## Here's the BIG check-list of items we need to check off

-   [ ] Add `Code Transformation` & `Code Gen` compiler steps (although this is mostly a (parser+eval) interpreter as of now)
-   [ ] Better & standard regular expressions to generate the `tokens`
-   [x] Support `Local` & `Global` bindings. (using the keyword `let`)
-   [ ] More `core-lib` functions
-   [ ] Support both `named` & `anonymous` functions.
-   [ ] Add `macro` support
-   [ ] Add functions for user-IO
-   [ ] Better error handling
-   [ ] Concurrency support
-   [ ] `Compiling` down to machine code, that can be run! (Super exciting)

This is a long road and I hope to learn as much as I can by doing this project.
I'm certainly excited about this!

Thanks for stopping by. _Ciao!_
